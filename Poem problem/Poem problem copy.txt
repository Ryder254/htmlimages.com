<h1> HTML EXERCISE ON POEM PROBLEM</h1>
<p> In this section I ian muindi is going to do a practical on poem problem<br>As discussed ealier in the html tutorial, a browser ignores extra spaces which may be on a paragraph</p>
<p style="font-family:CASTELLAR;"><b><mark>Lets think about a poem which has short lines that one must space</mark></b></p>
<p>In order to maintain the spaces in a poem,<br>We uses a <mark><em><strong><ins>PRE</ins></strong></em></mark> attribute meaning preserving the spaces and other poem styles.</p>
<h2>Here is an example of a poem whoses spaces are not preserved, but are in the coding<h2>
         <p>I am not for everyone.
       I know my truth, i know who I am,
       I know what I do and do not bring,
      to the table.I'm not easy to deal with
           but I do bring tons of value.
            I bring love and strength,
         but I am not perfect, and if
       I don't fit in with a person or group
          that is okay with me.</p>
<p> As seen above, the poem did not follow the poem rules of short sentences and spaces since we used a paragraph tag which ignores some unnecessaly spaces.</p>
<h2>Here is another example where the <mark><b>pre</b></mark> attribute has been used<h2>
<pre>
          I am not for everyone.
       I know my truth, i know who I am,
       I know what I do and do not bring,
      to the table.I'm not easy to deal with
           but I do bring tons of value.
            I bring love and strength,
         but I am not perfect, and if
       I don't fit in with a person or group
          that is okay with me.
