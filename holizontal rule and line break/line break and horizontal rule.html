<h1>This is an exercise for HTML line breaks and horizontal rule</h1>
<p> In this execise, I ian muindi will focus with mainly line break and horizontal rule</P>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">LINE BREAK</h2>
<p> Line break is coded using <b><strong><em><mark><ins>BR</ins></mark></em></strong></b> code. the main reason why a line break is imputed is to jump into another line without starting a new paragraph</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center; color:rgb(150,230,0);">Here is an example of a line break</h3>
<p>These line has a line break here,<br>THis is the reason why the paragraph have started a new line</p>
<P style="text-size:50px;"><mark><b>NOTE??.. A line break and a horizontal rule as well has no end tag since they are empty HTML tags</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">HORIZONTAL RULE</h2>
<p>A horizontal rule is coded as<b><strong><em><mark><ins>HR</isn></mark></em></strong></b> code. The main reason why a horizontal rule is  used is to separate two information maybe which are contraly to each other</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center; color:rgb(150,230,0);">Here is an example of a horizontal rule</h3>
<p>These line has a horizontal rule here,<hr>This is the reason why there is line cutting horizontally above since I have imputed a horizontal rule</p>
